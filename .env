######## CHANGE to some random IF database is not dockerized. Or I will connect to your database and delete all pr0n. ########
dbPass=AaAa1234

# CHANGE to the database IP address. Find this IP using command 'ip a' on the database host.
# Database host. Only change this if you want to use your own existing Postgres server. Yes, we are using own existing server.
#If using your own server, you can remove the 'db' container from docker-compose.yml. Already removed.

# Set the names of the docker containers to your own entries. Or don't, I'm not your dad.
